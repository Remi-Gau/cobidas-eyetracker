# Guideline for Reporting Standards of Eye-tracking Research in Decision Sciences

This checklist is based on following work:

> Fiedler, S., Schulte-Mecklenbeck, M., Renkewitz, F., & Orquin, J. L. (2020, September 11). Guideline for Reporting Standards of Eye-tracking Research in Decision Sciences. https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/f6qcy

The items reported were turned into [a] spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aQZINzS24oYDgu6PZ8djqZQZ2s2eNs2xP6kyzHokU8o/edit?usp=sharing) and then converted into a schema and rendered with the user-interface you are now using.

## How to use it

You can navigate each section on the left and then answer the questions corresponding to your methods and analysis. This is meant to make sure that you have not forgotten any of the essential information during data collection or later in the methods and results parts of your article.

At the end, you can click on `Export` (bottom left) to get a zip file containing machine readable json files that captures information about your method/results section

## Why this project?

Poor methods and results description hinders the reproducibility and the replicability of research. It also makes it hard to compare new and old results and generally increases inefficiency in the research process. This project is built on the hope that improving methods and results reporting could improve our research.

## Want to help? 

We have a [list](https://github.com/Remi-Gau/COBIDAS_chckls/blob/master/goals.md) of short, middle, long term goals: if you are interested by any of those get in touch. Many of them do not necessarily require super-advanced technical skills (except maybe a certain love for working with spreadsheet and wanting them to be super organized) :wink:.

We are currently working on trying to expand the number of items used in the checklist. All of this work is done in google spreadsheets.

- The MRI spreadsheet is accessible [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dCXP0MTK3DjY09ZFd7FXgv0Ngx16_YJwVBiXOeQbTho/edit?usp=sharing)
- The M/EEG spreadsheet is accessible [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OhkmbtgIWdFxSVjpu6A8PWoAuqev0jY-98GFQlwBCy0/edit?usp=sharing)
- The PET spreadsheet is accessible [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HS-1KOP8nE7C3MHiyRmQ6hd823cBZnCRVq0UryXvDc8/edit?usp=sharing)
